# Unity_AnAssemblyOfShortProjects

I added here a few short projects that I did in last few years, so some of them where need to migrate.
I didn't include Library folders from the projects and I added Exe_Application folders with an exe files of each application. But be careful, in summary it weigth ~290Mb.

Which Projects I have:
1. moving_test - just an application for checking the main Unity possibilities in 2D mode.
2. Platformer. I tried to make the logic maximality splited/divided here. Project wasn't completely done in case of Editor, but it is Ok to play and to add maps manually (in resourses).
3. Three in row. Here provided the main mechanic of one of the popular casual game genre.
